This is the ghost of a failed project.

I hoped to be able to find the locations of each of a person's Facebook friends, but the Facebook Graph Search API does not give access to this information.
Instead, the best I can do is print out a list of friends' names, but no unique identifiers.

My goal was to find the Members of Congress for each of a person's friends, so if your friend has a MoC with a view you disagree with, you may consider reaching out to that friend so they can reach out to their MoC.

I have an alternative, simpler script which works for Senators but not Representatives here: https://github.com/artoonie/RedStatesBlueStates
